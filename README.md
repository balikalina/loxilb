## What is loxilb

loxilb is an open source hyper-scale software load-balancer for cloud-native workloads. It uses eBPF as its core-engine and is based on Golang. It is designed to power on-premise, edge and public-cloud Kubernetes cluster deployments.

###  ðŸš€ loxilb aims to provide the following :   

- Service type load-balancer for kubernetes   
    * L4/NAT stateful loadbalancer   
    * NAT44, NAT66, NAT64 with One-ARM, FullNAT, DSR etc   
    * Support for TCP, UDP, SCTP (w/ multi-homing), FTP, TFTP etc   
    * High-availability support with hitless/maglev clustering   
    * Full compliance for K8s loadbalancer Spec
    * Multi-cluster support      
-  Extensive and scalable liveness probes for cloud-native environments    
-  High-perf replacement for the *aging* iptables/ipvs   
-  L7 proxy support   
-  Telco/5G/6G friendly features    
    * GTP tunnels as first class citizens     
    * Optimized SRv6 implementation    
    * Support for UL-CL with LB, QFI and other utility extensions  

### ðŸ§¿ loxilb is powered by :   
- Bespoke GoLang based control plane components     
- [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) based data-path forwarding   
   * Home-grown stack with advanced features like [Conntrack](https://thermalcircle.de/doku.php?id=blog:linux:connection_tracking_1_modules_and_hooks), QoS etc
   * Complete kernel networking bypass    
   * Highly scalable with low-latency & high throughput   
- GoLang based easy to use APIs/Interfaces infra   
- Seamless integration with goBGP based routing stack
